## 1.0 Introduction
<p align="justify">Meet RajaMark, your reliable helper to automate the grading of multiple-choice question (MCQ)
answer sheets. By leveraging Tesseract OCR for handwritten text recognition and OpenCV for
image preprocessing, RajaMark can swiftly and accurately interpret handwritten answers (A-E)
beside question numbers. This automation eliminates the tedious and error-prone manual grading
process, making it ideal for educational institutions seeking a more efficient grading solution.</p>

<p align="justify">In addition to grading, RajaMark offers tools to compile class results, allowing educators to
aggregate individual scores and generate comprehensive reports on class performance in quizzes
and tests. This feature helps teachers quickly identify trends and areas for improvement,
streamlining the assessment process. Overall, RajaMark is a valuable resource for schools and
universities aiming to improve the speed and accuracy of MCQ evaluation while reducing the
workload on educators.</p>

## 5.0 Best Practices
### 5.1 Grading Tips
1. Ensure students format answers consistently and legibly to aid OCR accuracy.
<p align="center">
  <img width="40%" src="https://github.com/WIF3002-OCR-MCQ/rajamark/assets/117422678/94b5a288-465d-4c08-9dd1-e049bdbaf3f7">
</p>

2. Advise clear separation of answers for each question to minimize ambiguity.
<p align="center">
  <img width="40%" src="https://github.com/WIF3002-OCR-MCQ/rajamark/assets/117422678/4f3991b5-38f0-49f4-997e-fe8690089e31">
</p>

3. Caution against overlapping answers to enhance OCR interpretation.
<p align="center">
  <img width="40%" src="https://github.com/WIF3002-OCR-MCQ/rajamark/assets/117422678/b571b39a-d102-407f-b5c0-0eabfb1a4f67">
</p>

4. Scan answers at high resolution in well-lit conditions for optimal recognition.
5. Encourage manual review of extracted text for clarity before submission.
6. Ensure students use dark, bold pens or pencils for writing to improve OCR readability.
<p align="center">
  <img width="40%" src="https://github.com/WIF3002-OCR-MCQ/rajamark/assets/117422678/85174803-2eaa-41de-a491-3dcb6072e277">
</p>

7. Remind students to avoid excessive use of decorative elements or symbols that may
interfere with OCR recognition.
<p align="center">
  <img width="40%" src="https://github.com/WIF3002-OCR-MCQ/rajamark/assets/117422678/2a9bc8fc-ff90-44c1-aa21-f0606b4b39c5">
</p>

8. Provide guidelines for students to write numbers and symbols clearly, especially those
prone to misinterpretation
9. Advise against folding or creasing answer sheets, as it can distort text and hinder OCR
accuracy.
10. Recommend students to use a ruler or straight edge for neat alignment of answers to
improve OCR alignment.
<p align="center">
  <img width="40%" src="https://github.com/WIF3002-OCR-MCQ/rajamark/assets/117422678/d883fc15-0c17-4c09-b5e8-e6d7a40761d7">
</p>

### Accuracy Recommendations
1. Provide clear handwriting guidelines to optimize OCR recognition; for example, require
all multiple-choice answers to be in capital letters.
2. Conduct regular practice sessions to familiarize students with handwriting recognition
and improve their writing.
3. Offer constructive feedback to students to enhance handwriting quality and OCR
accuracy.
4. Provide comprehensive user training to educators to address accuracy challenges
effectively.
5. Develop a standardized answer sheet template with clear instructions and designated
areas for answers to facilitate OCR processing.
6. Encourage students to practice writing in a consistent style and size to aid OCR
recognition.
